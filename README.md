This is the code behind the report ["Forecasting Technology Performance: Initial Tests with Time Series Extrapolation and Patent Data"](https://github.com/jeffalstott/technologytimeseries_forecasting/blob/master/manuscript/Forecasting%20Technology%20Performance-Initial%20Tests%20with%20Time%20Series%20Extrapolation%20and%20Patent%20Data.pdf), written for IARPA.

The `data` directory has the raw data, the `manuscript` directory has the `LaTeX` code and figures that created the manuscript, and the `src` directory has the source code. The source code is embarassingly disorganized, because it is primarily code that was written during the exploratory phases of the research, not the final production code. The production code that was actually used for the manuscript is [Manuscript_Figures.ipynb](https://github.com/jeffalstott/technologytimeseries_forecasting/blob/master/src/Manuscript_Figures.ipynb). Everything else is kept for posterity. Feel free to reach out to the author if you've questions/comments/concerns/stories.
